I am Mayank, a senior year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India. Have been drinking the crypto elixir for more than 2 years now. Recently, I have been involved in homomorphic encryption and it's practical intersection with database management systems and machine learning.
