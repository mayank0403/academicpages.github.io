I am Mayank, a senior year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India. Have been drinking the crypto elixir for more than 2 years now. Recently, I have been involved in homomorphic encryption and it's practical intersection with database management systems and machine learning. I have also worked extensively on packing methods for somewhat homomorphic schemes that enable us to pack input data to a valid and distinct element from the plaintext domain. Apart from this, these summers I worked at TokyoTech on Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies as well as hybrid and modular cryptocurrency frameworks like Scorex. As far as public key encryption and integer factorization is concerned, I have done some implementations and studied through this domain passing through the Number Field Sieve algorithm as well. 

As a part of my Bachelor Thesis supervised by Prof. K. K. Shukla, I am working on a secure online learning protocol with encrypted querying.
