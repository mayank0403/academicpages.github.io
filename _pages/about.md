### Updates!
I have been working as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research Bangalore working in cryptography, mainly MPC and secure hardware (SGX), and compilers. I have been a major contributor of <a href = "https://github.com/mpc-msri/EzPC">CrypTFlow</a> project and we have recently written <a href = "https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1049.pdf">this</a> paper on our work.

I am applying for PhD programs in cryptography/security for Fall 2020.

I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University (IIT BHU), Varanasi, India with majors in Computer Science and Engineering in May 2018.

### News!

I am taking the laboratory classes of sophomore students for the course of Artificial Intelligence.

We are hosting the annual coding festival - <a href = "http://codefest.tech/">Codefest</a>, of the <a href = "http://www.iitbhu.ac.in/cse/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT (BHU), Varanasi</a> from 22-24th September 2017. I have personally set up 5-10 questions spanning cryptographic principles and cryptocurrency protocols for Capture the Flag event. Please register before the event starts on 22nd September 00:00 IST. Awesome challenging crypto single-sentence-answer questions waiting for you there.

Interested in reading about zkSNARKS? Check this awesome blog <a href = "https://media.consensys.net/introduction-to-zksnarks-with-examples-3283b554fc3b">post</a> out, along with <a href = "https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/05/zksnarks-in-a-nutshell/">this</a>!

Check out this <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKKafEBx5P4">demo</a> of PyAono's first release. This tutorial uses a pruned space for sampling uniformly and lacks a cryptographically secure PRNG, which we will implement soon, for the sake of presentation. I have used a naive packing method in the tutorial. If an array of integers in passed, then the matrix can compute on this whole batch in one go instead of using a single integer once and then filling up the whole matrix with this integer or placing the integer at first place followed by 0s. Please check out the API description of the <a href = "https://github.com/OpenMined/PyAono">PyAono</a> repo for details about the functions.

Interesting post by a project colleague on using MPC for machine learning - <a href = "https://mortendahl.github.io/2017/04/17/private-deep-learning-with-mpc/">here</a>!

Check out my <a href = "https://mayank0403.github.io/files/twinscoin.pdf">presentation</a> on TwinsCoin - a modular cryptocurrency framework, originally authored by Alexander Chepurnoy, my colleague from TokyoTech project, presented by me at TokyoTech.
