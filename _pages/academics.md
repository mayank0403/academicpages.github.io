Education
======
* B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, 2018 (expected)

Experience
======
* Summer 2017: Visiting Researcher
  * Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan 
  * Topic: Cryptocurrency protocols and Scorex
  * Tasks completed: Actively contributed to the Scorex project (my contributions are available on the Github page of the
project) - A modular cryptocurrency framework by Input-Output Hong Kong, China, and extensively
investigated the existing proof-of-work and proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies.
  * Supervisor: Professor Keisuke Tanaka
  
* Summer 2017: Visiting Researcher
  * Saitama University, Japan 
  * Topic: Secure and efficient protocols for threshold queries over encrypted databases
  * Tasks completed: Developed an efficient secure integer comparison protocol to facilitate secure and practical threshold
queries over encrypted databases using Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption and a multiparty secure
sorting method. Implemented complex cryptographic protocols and a Fully Homomorphic Encryption
scheme based on Ring-LWE.
  * Supervisor: Professor Takeshi Koshiba
  
* Winter 2016-17: Visiting Researcher
  * Saitama University, Japan 
  * Topic: Querying over encrypted databases using Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption
  * Tasks completed: Developed an encrypted database system supporting equality queries and implemented secure comparison
protocols in C++ using PARI library, based on somewhat homomorphic encryption.
  * Supervisor: Professor Takeshi Koshiba
  
* August 2017 - present: Remote Research Project
  * OpenMined, UK 
  * Topic: Decentralized AI
  * Tasks running: Working on C++ implementations (with PARI library) of core Cryptographic functions to support prediction
tasks on encrypted Neural Networks.
  * Tasks completed: Already pushed initial APIs for the homomorphic repositories of PyAono, PyBV, PyYASHE which can all be found on the GitHub page of OpenMined Organization.
  * Supervisor: Andrew Trask (Ph.D student at UOxford)
  
* Summer 2016: Research Internship
  * SAG, Defense Research and Development Organization, New Delhi 
  * Topic: Development and analysis of Public Key Cryptography
  * Tasks completed: Implemented Public Key Cryptography Schemes, Integer Factorization algorithms and extensively studied Number Field Sieve with focus on CADO-NFS software.
  * Supervisor:  Dr. Saibal Pal

* Jan 2016 - present: Bachelor Thesis project
  * Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi
  * Topic: Secure Machine Learning
  * Tasks running: Working on encrypted neural networks based on somewhat homomorphic encryption and already implemented
secure logistic regression using somewhat homomorphic encryption (using SEAL library).
  * Future Tasks: Deploying a secure online learning system facilitating encrypted querying and prediction.
  * Supervisor:  Professor K. K. Shukla
  
* Jan - Oct 2016: Project
  * Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi
  * Topic: Part-of-Speech Tagging of Bhojpuri language data
  * Tasks running: Implemented and analyzed the results of POS Tagging of Bhojpuri language data using MaxEnt,
CRF++, SVMStruct and Trigrams & Tags. A performance comparison was also done with Hindi language
for each of the taggers.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Anil Kumar Singh

Teaching Experience
======
* CSE241N - Artificial Intelligence Fall'18
  * Tutor/Teaching Assistant Fall semester 2018. I am taking the laboratory sessions and designing the serial assignments for sophomore students taking the course.
  
* CSE-291: Exploratory Project Fall'18
  * Undergraduate Project mentor Fall semester 2018. I am mentoring a sophomore students in his project on Cryptography, particularly homomorphic encryption. He is implementing the YASHE scheme in C++.
  
* CSE-392: UG Project Fall'18
  * Undergraudate Project mentor Fall semester 2018. I am mentoring 2 junior undergraduate students in their thesis project on the fascinating intersection Cryptography and Machine Learning.
